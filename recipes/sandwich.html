    <p>Mornings are a sacred time. It's the first opportunity that you get to set the mood for the rest of your day. I am my best self when I am adhering to a productive, regular A.M. ritual. You know, all the good stuff. Making your bed, brewing a fresh pot of coffee, tidying up the kitchen, maybe getting in a quick meditation or writing a few things down in a journal–a few basic exercises to warm up your mind and body for a successful day.</p>

    <p>    I am no doctor, but from personal experience, I can say that an important component to a great morning routine is a solid breakfast. For me, the most versatile, exciting, and wholesome meal to kick off the day is a breakfast sandwich. They're endlessly customizable (so you'll never get sick of 'em), they'll keep you full, and most importantly, they're a meal that you'll actually look forward to eating.
        
        All you need to make a tasty, hearty breakfast sandwich is a couple minutes and a few humble ingredients that are probably already in your pantry and refrigerator. Here are 8 of my favorite, 5-ingredient breakfast sandwiches that are perfect for every morning.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>veggies</li>
        <li>cheese slice</li>
        <li>& whatever u like :)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim the edges of the bread slices</li>
        <li>Spread a generous amount of butter on each bread slice
        </li>
        <li>Now spread the green chutney evenly on each slice as well. Use as much or as little as you need
        </li>
        <li>Now place the boiled potatoes on 3 slices in one even layer
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle some cumin powder and black salt over this
        </li>
        <li>Next, layer cucumber, onions, and tomato slices
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle more cumin powder and black salt
        </li>
        <li>Place another slice of bread over this that has been buttered and spread with chutney as well
        </li>
        <li>Press down gently so that the ingredients stick together and don’t fall out easily
        </li>
        <li>Repeat until you have 3 large sandwiches
        </li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to further quarter each into 4 smaller pieces
        </li>
        <li>Plate them and serve immediately with more green chutney, if needed
        </li>
    </ol>
